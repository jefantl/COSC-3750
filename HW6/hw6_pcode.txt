for each argument from command line:
  if the first character is "-":
    loop through flags and set appropiate bool values
  else:
    break

if there is still an argument left:
  set file path to that argument
else:
  set filepath to current

open filepath as directory
for each object in directory:
  create string versions of each piece of data we want to write out
  we may change these strings based on the set flags
  print formatted string consisting of each piece of data
